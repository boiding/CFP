This repository contains information needed to answer call for papers.

It is modeled after the [Booster Conf 2020][booster] call for papers request.

## Talk length
3 hours

## Title
a murmuring of mesmerizing starlings.

## Abstract
Seeing a big flock of birds flying as if they are one organism is a mesmerizing
experience. One often wonders: "How do these birds ``know'' what to do?".

Although the overall behavior of the flock seems very complex, it is an emergent
property of a few simple rules.

In an elegant algorithm Craig Reynolds showed that flocking behavior is possible
if birds seek to

1. Avoid collisions by separating from there immediate neighbors.
2. Aligning themselves in the direction the group is moving.
3. Seeking to minimize exposure by trying to move towards the center of the
   flock.
   
In this workshop you will get to learn about these rules in detail by commanding
your own flock of virtual creatures. Your task is to program the brains of your
obedient birds and see how from your code flocking emerges.
In the virtual world you will encounter other species, both docile and predatory,
that offer new challenges.

You will walk away with a new understanding of the complex interplay of 
interacting systems, how intricate behavior can emerge from simple rules and a
new appriciation of the natural world.

## What roles is this workshop appropriate for?
Developer, Tester/Test lead, Architect, Designer

## Outline
We will start with by welcoming the participants to our workshop, introducing
ourselves and detailing the agenda and goal.
Next we will briefly explain the flocking algorithm, highlighting the key
concepts and showing where participants can learn more about the details. We
will provide them with reading material and a guide.
Next the participants can implements their agents, diving directly in the meat
of the algorithm, working from the starter kits we provide them. Participants
can monitor their progress via a classroom visualization of their flock.
We will close with a group discussion of the hurdles that were overcome,
insights gained and experiences counted.
